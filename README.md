# CreditCheck

Suppose a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers finds it hard to give loans to the people due to their insufficient or non-existent credit history. Because of that, some consumers use it as their advantage by becoming a defaulter.
As Data Analyst, we have to use EDA to analyse the patterns present in the data. This will ensure that the applicants capable of repaying the loan are not rejected and aaplicants incapable of repaying the loan are not approved.
EDA will be used to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.
